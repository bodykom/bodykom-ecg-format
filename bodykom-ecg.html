  <h1>Bodykom ECG Data file format</h1>
  <p>
    <em>Richard W, HP, September 2007</em><br>
    <em>Fredrik J, Wip, January 2018</em>
  </p>

<p>This is an overview of the ECG data file format of ECG session files
exported from Bodykom. The file format is compatible with <em>SR
Medizinelektronik Cardio Explorer</em> ECG analysis software</p>

<h2>2. File format requirements</h2>

<p>The data from an ECG session is exported as a zip file.</p>

<p>The zip file contains three mandatory files and one optional file that as a
whole represent the data from a single ECG session. The files are contained in
a subdirectory in the zip file. The name of the directory and files are based on
the id of the sensor and the date time of the start of the session. The content
of the files are identified by their respective file suffix, <code>t0</code>,
<code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, and <code>2</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>.t0</code> - Event Marker list, <em>optional</em>. Contains
    block sequence number of all user initatied event markers. When no user
    events have been created during a ECG recording session this file is
    omitted.</li>
  <li><code>.0</code> - Header data, 512 bytes block</li>
  <li><code>.1</code> - the ECG data representing Channel 1, prefixed by a 512 byte header data block.</li>
  <li><code>.2</code> - the ECG data representing Channel 2, prefixed by a 512 byte header data block.</li>
</ul>

<p>The header data block in the .0 file is repeated at the start of both the ECG
data files 1 and 2.</p>

<p> The files <code>.0</code>, <code>.1</code>, and <code>.2</code> are
required in order to display and analyse the ECG data with the Cardio Explorer
software. The <code>.t0</code> file is optional.</p>

<h2>3. Header file</h2>
<h3>3.1. Header format</h3>

<p>The header file contains a fixed size 512 byte block with fields defined
per the following table.</p>

<p><em>Note!</em> Bodykom applies default values for most of the fields
with the notable exception of the registration date fields.</p>

<p>Gaps between code groups, one byte, are filled with 0x00.</p>

<p>All char fields are ANSI strings, padded by zero (0x00). Each field
contains at least one 0x00 byte.</p>

<p> Fields, representing numeric values (height, weight, ...), are left

<p>Currently the ECG file format version "001" is the only supported ECG data

<p> The birthdate details are left blank, as are the height and weight details.
The Patient Id is set to the communicator ID of the Bodykom Client Device
and so is the Patient surname field. The Patient firstname field is currently
left blank by the Bodykom app.</p>

<p> The Registration date and time is set as the start timestamp of the
ECG recording session.</p>

<h2>4. ECG data files</h2>
<h3>4.1. Body format</h3>

<p>The first 512 bytes of data in both channel date files contains a copy of
the header file <code>.0</code>. The ECG data within the data channel files,
<code>1</code> and <code>2</code> is defined as little endian 16-bit values.
The zero-point is set at 16000, and each 1mV gain corresponds to 3200.</p>

<h3>4.1. ECG data transformation</h3>

<p>The Transformation algorithm works on a channel by channel basis, and
processes each segment of ECG data in following steps.</p>

<ul>
  <li> 1. A segment of of hub formatted data containing a contigous group of
  sample blocks - where each block contains 255 samples per channel - which is
  processed on a block-by-block basis by retrieving the relevant channel data
  from each block and then creating a continuous array of single channel
  data.</li>

  <li> 2. This single channel array is converted to little-endian array of shorts
    two bytes at a time. This is described by the following short code snippet.<br>

<pre><code>
  private static short readShortLittleEndian(byte b1, byte b2) {
    int low = b1 &amp; 0xff;
    int high = b2 &amp; 0xff;
    return(short)( high &lt;&lt; 8 | low );
  }
</code></pre>
<p>This conversion essentially just reverses the position of the two bytes and
  returns them as a short - for example 3E D9 would become D9 3E.</p>
  </li>

<li>The converted data for each channel is written to the relevant channel
  file, i.e 1 or 2 so that the channel samples for a specific timestamp
  correlates to the same file position in each channel data file.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. The event marker file</h2>

<p>A person who wears a Bodykom sensor, can record user initiated
events by tapping the ECG sensor so that the built in accelerometer detects
a vibration. Each such event is recorded as a part of the current block. User
events are identified by the Bodykom app and the current block sequence number
and current time is recorded as event markers, and the markers are transmitted
to the server.</p>

<p>A ECG session may or may not contain any event markers. If a session
contains at least one event marker a <code>t0</code>-file is added to the zip
file. When no event markers are present during a session, no event marker
file is generated.</p>

<p>The t0 file contains a series of event markers, where each marker is
represented by four bytes. The first byte of each marker record always contains
0x00, followed by a tree byte little endian integer that identifies the block
sequence number - offset relative to the first block of the session - where the
marker occurred.</p>

<h3>5.1. Event marker file example</h3>

Each marker is represented by four bytes. First always 0x00, then the
block sequence number in little endian format, low byte, middle byte, high
byte. Each sample block contains 255 samples and is 1707 ms long.  So to
compute the block sequence number of a event marker recorded at a certain
time, subtract the event marker time with the start time, divided by 1707
ms. See the following examples.</p>

<pre><code>
Marker 1 = 00 0A 00 00 = 0Ah  = 10d   * 1,707s = 17s
Marker 2 = 00 14 00 00 = 14h  = 20d   * 1,707s = 34s
Marker 2 = 00 26 00 00 = 26h  = 38d   * 1,707s = 65s = 1'5"
Marker 3 = 00 62 01 00 = 162h = 354d  * 1,707s = 604s = 10'4"
Marker 4 = 00 09 04 00 = 409h = 1033d * 1,707s = 1763s = 29'23"
Marker 5 = 00 D6 05 00 = 5D6h = 1494d * 1,707s = 2550s = 42'30"
</code></pre>
